## Installation

### Bundler

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "commit_msg_ai"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

### Making the Script Executable
After installation, if you want to run the commit_msg_ai.rb script directly from the command line, you need to set the executable flag for the file.

If you donâ€™t set the executable flag, you would have to run the Ruby file like this:

```bash
$ ruby lib/commit_msg_ai.rb
```
After running the following command to set the executable flag, you can run the script like this (assuming the file starts with a valid shebang line):

```bash
$ chmod +x lib/commit_msg_ai.rb
$ ./lib/commit_msg_ai.rb
```
This makes the commit_msg_ai.rb file executable, allowing you to run it directly from the terminal without needing to prepend ruby.

### Setting the OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN
To use the commit_msg_ai gem, you need to provide your OpenAI API token. This token is required for authenticating requests to the OpenAI API.

Follow these steps to set the OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable:

1. Obtain your OpenAI API key:

Go to OpenAI's API page and generate a new API key.

2. Set the environment variable:

On macOS/Linux: Open your terminal and add the following line to your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or ~/.bash_profile depending on the shell you're using):

```bash
export OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-api-key-here"
```

After editing the file, run the following command to reload the configuration:

```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc   # or ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile, etc.
```

On Windows:

Open Command Prompt and set the environment variable with the following command:

```cmd
setx OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN "your-api-key-here"
```

Alternatively, you can add the environment variable through the System Properties > Environment Variables settings.

3. Verify that the variable is set correctly:

You can check if the environment variable is set by running this command:

```bash
$ echo $OPENAI_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
This should print your OpenAI API key.
